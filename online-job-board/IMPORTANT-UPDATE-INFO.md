# Important: Update Protection

## üîí This Plugin Will NOT Update from WordPress.org

This plugin is **your own custom plugin** created by **Sakib Islam** (+880 195 002 5990).

### Why No Updates?

There's another plugin with a similar name on WordPress.org by a different author. To prevent your plugin from being overwritten by that author's plugin, we've implemented the following protections:

### Protection Methods Implemented:

1. **Unique Plugin Name**
   - Plugin Name: "Job Board by Sakib Islam"
   - Text Domain: "job-board-sakib"

2. **Update URI Disabled**
   - Added `Update URI: false` in plugin header
   - This tells WordPress not to check for updates

3. **Update Filters**
   - Filters to block WordPress.org updates:
     - `site_transient_update_plugins` - Removes update notices
     - `auto_update_plugin` - Disables automatic updates

### What This Means:

‚úÖ **Good News:**
- Your plugin will NEVER be replaced by another author's code
- You have complete control over the plugin
- No risk of losing your custom features

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
- You won't receive automatic updates
- You need to manually update if you want new features
- This is YOUR plugin - you can modify it freely

### If You Want Updates:

If you want to add new features or make changes:

1. **Edit the code directly** - All files are yours to modify
2. **Version control** - Use Git to track your changes
3. **Custom updates** - You control when and what to update
